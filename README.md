# Drop Impact Analysis on Submerged Sediments


 This project is part of a larger graduate research study focused on understanding the effects of rainfall on soil behavior. As a starting point, we are conducting controlled experiments to observe how a single water droplet interacts with submerged sediments, specifically using glass beads as a simplified soil model.

## Experimental Setup:

We place a layer of glass bead sediments at the bottom of a transparent container filled with water. A single water droplet is released from above, falling into the container and impacting the submerged sediment layer. The entire process is recorded using a high-speed camera for analysis.

## Objectives:

- The goal is to measure and understand:

- Droplet dynamics – How fast the droplet is moving when it hits the water surface (measured in frames per second).

- Impact displacement – The size and shape of the water bulge created when the droplet hits.

- Sediment movement – How much and how far the glass bead sediments are displaced as a result of the impact.

## Current Methods:

At this stage, we are using traditional image processing techniques to analyze the footage (e.g., frame-by-frame tracking, edge detection, etc.). However, we’re also exploring more advanced methods that could improve precision—such as machine learning-based analysis or other robust computer vision approaches.
